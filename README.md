This is mostly a project for me to learn about the kivy python library for making apps. 

I will try to make an android app of the N-back test, with options for single, dual, and triple N-back test and with score boards to track progress.


To Do:
make main page
	title
	buttons linking to 3 types of n-back
	button to about page
	button to high scores
make game
	make grid
	clock which makes tiles light up
	buttons for matching tile/sound/colour
	title saying value of N
	Pop up with score
	If high score, then ask for name and save to high scores (use input dialog, use text hint, make required field, set max text length to 3)
make about page
	Explain rules
	link to github etc.
Make highscore tables
	buttons to different types of test
	Table showing high scores
Make settings page
	Option to change to dark mode (use theme picker) (toast to indicate that it has been done)
